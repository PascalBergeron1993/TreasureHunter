Treasure Hunter is an application created by Pascal Bergeron that allows people
to scan their storage devices for the presence of Bitcoin wallets. It can
detect many types of wallets even if they were renamed or moved elsewhere
in an attempt to hide them. You can find more information at https://pascal-bergeron.com/en/posts/treasure-hunter/
